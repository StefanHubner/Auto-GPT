ai_goals:
  - Wait for human feedback that will provide me with a topic and write a report about it in latex citing the sources you used
  - Use google_api command to collect information and decide on the three most relevant sections
  - For each section use the google_api command to obtain more detailed content using separate searches, summarise each of them and write them into a separate LaTex files without a preamble
  - Write an introduction summarising all sections, also without a preamble
  - Create a standalone LaTex document with a descriptive report title and use the latex command 'input' to include the introduction followed by the three sections and a bibliography
  - Compile the tex file for the report using execute_shell_popen with pdflatex command
