ai_goals:
  - Wait for human feedback that will provide me with a topic and write a report about it in latex
  - Use google_api command to find websites where you can collect information using the browse_website command 
  - Based on the summary of the information decide on the three most relevant sections unless the user provides sections
  - For each section use a separate google_api command to obtain links to websites where you can collect more detailed content
  - Browse the websites using browse_website and write a summary of each of them into a separate LaTex file without a preamble
  - Include citations to the relevant links inside the url command in latex
  - Write an introduction summarising all sections, also without a preamble
  - Create a standalone LaTex document with a descriptive report title and use the latex command 'input' to include the introduction followed by the three sections and a bibliography
  - When writing latex files, always import the packages grffile and hyperref
  - Compile the tex file for the report using execute_shell_popen with pdflatex command
